# Chess-influence-Analysis-
This project takes in portable game notation and generates a set of images showing the current board ownership as a ratio for each square. 

The analysis is done by Chess_Compute_V9.1.py. This is the primary file, it does the computation and generates the output images. 

chessanalysis_input.py is for holding the PGN. It is a Python file for editing convenience on mobile IDE's

Slideshow_V9.1.py is an accessory script for convenience of seeing the output on a mobile device. This is not vital.
